1.What is statically typed and dynamically typed Programming language?
Ans:-Statically typed programming languages are languages in which the data type is required to be specified for a variable.

Whereas,in dynamic typed programming languages the data type is not required to be specified for a variable. The variable stores data according to the type assigned.

2. What is the variable in java?
Ans:-A variable is the name of a memory allocated reserved area, or in other words it is the name of the memory location.

3. How to assign a value to variable?

4. What are Primitive data types in java?

6. List the Operators in java?
Ans:-The operators in java are:
        a)Arithmetic Operators.
        b)Assignment Operators.
        c)Logical Operators.
        d)Relational Operators.
        e)Unary Operators.
        f)Bitwise Operators.
        
7. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples.
Ans:-The increment (++) operators are unary operators, which means they operate on a single operand. They are used to increase the value of an integer, floating-point, or character by 1.
Eg:- Code
        int a = 5;
        System.out.println(a++);
       Output
        6

The decrement (--) operators are unary operators, which means they operate on a single operand. They are used to decrease the value of an integer, floating-point, or character by 1.
Eg:- Code
        int a = 5;
        System.out.println(aâ€“);
       Output
        4
