Solution: From the given recurrence relation we can obtain the value of different parameters such as a, b, p, and
k.
The relation : T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n2logn
Here, a = 16
b = 4
k = 2
p = 1
bk = 42 = 16
Here a = bk
Also p > -1

Hence T(n) = θ(nlogab * logp+1n)
Therefore T(n) = θ(nlog164 * log1+1n) = θ(n1/2log2n)(Ans)
