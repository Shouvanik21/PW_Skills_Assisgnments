1.What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans:-The default value of array for different data types are:
          a)boolean - false
          b)int - 0
          c)double - 0.0
          d)String - null

2.Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
Ans:-No, negative numbers cannot be passed to the array size.It will show error.

3.Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
Ans:-Since array is an object it is stored in the heap area of the JVM.

4.What are the disadvantages of Array?
Ans:-The disadvantages of array are:

The insertion or deletion of an element from the array occurs from the end only.

5.What is an Anonymous Array in Java. Give an example.
Ans:-An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array. It is an array just for creating and using instantly. Using an anonymous array, we can pass an array with user values without the referenced variable.

Syntax:

new data_type[]{//set of values separated by comma};

Eg:-
New int[]{1,2,3,4};
New String[]{“Ram”,“Rahul”,“Shyam”};

6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
Ans:-The two ways to traverse an array are:
1)Normal way:-

Int arr[] = {1,2,3,4};
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
{
     System.out.println(i);
}

2)Enhanced for loop:-

Int arr[] = {5,6,7,8,};
for(int a : arr)
{
     System.out.println(a);
}

7.What is the difference between length and length() method.     Give an examples.
Ans:- The length property is used with the array to know the size of the array.

Eg:-

int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int size = arr.length;

Output:-

4

The length() method is used with the string object and is used the tell the no of characters in it.

Eg:-

String name =“Ram”;
int size = name.length();

Output:-

3
